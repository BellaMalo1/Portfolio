            <p>Hello Friend! My name is Bella Maldonado and I am a Queer Latina Software Engineer from Phoenix, Arizona. A little bit about me...I was fortunate enough to attend Loyola Marymount Univerity in Los Angeles, California. I gratuded with honors in the spring of 2020, double majoring in Psychology and Art History. Gratuding during a global pandemic really threw me for a loop, career wise. I've worked in museums, outdoors camps, and sales. Quite the mish-mash of things! Somehow, I decided that software engineering would be just the thing to bring me down a notch after finally feeling like I had my hands around sales. So... here I am, humbling myself by mastering a new skill, taking everyday with patience, knowing that I will be better than the last.</p>
